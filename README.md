In mathematics, Pascal's triangle is a triangular array of the binomial coefficients arising in probability theory, combinatorics, and algebra. In much of the Western world, it is named after the French mathematician Blaise Pascal, although other mathematicians studied it centuries before him in Persia,[1] India,[2] China, Germany, and Italy.[3]



#HISTORY

The pattern of numbers that forms Pascal's triangle was known well before Pascal's time. The Persian mathematician Al-Karaji (953–1029) wrote a now-lost book which contained the first formulation of the binomial coefficients and the first description of Pascal's triangle.[5][6][7] It was later repeated by Omar Khayyám (1048–1131), another Persian mathematician; thus the triangle is also referred to as the Khayyam's triangle (مثلث خیام) in Iran.[8] Several theorems related to the triangle were known, including the binomial theorem. Khayyam used a method of finding nth roots based on the binomial expansion, and therefore on the binomial coefficients.[1]
