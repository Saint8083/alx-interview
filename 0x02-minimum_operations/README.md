# Minimum Operations

In various problem-solving scenarios, it is often necessary to determine the minimum number of operations required to reach a specific number starting from a given value. In this article, we will explore an approach to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of operations required to reach a number N starting from 0. We will discuss an efficient algorithm to solve this problem, along with its time and space complexity.
